                     Nelia is a full-stack developer from Ukraine based in San Francisco, CA.
                       She has a serious passion for front-end development, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.<br />
                       <br />
                       Growing up in a small town in Ukraine just outside of Poltava, Nelia enjoyed the long summers working on her familyâ€™s farm - but her dreams of a bigger life quickly took hold of her as she left home to study abroad. 
                       <br />
                        She has a passion for learning and self-improvement and currently holds two Master's Degrees in International Economics and Educational Counseling, respectively. 
                        <br />
                        During the pandemic, life was put into perspective and her creative soul yearned to be fulfilled.
                        <br />
                          A close friend introduced her to CSS design, where she was hooked. 
                          <br />
                           She quickly enrolled and completed a boot camp at General Assembly. 
                            Nelia looks to continue her new found passion for design by aiding clients in their creative process for web development.
